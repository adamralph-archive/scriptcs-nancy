A [scriptcs](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs) [script pack](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Script-Packs-master-list) for [Nancy](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy).

Continue your journey down the super-duper-happy-path by self-hosting Nancy with a single line of code:
```C#
Require<NancyPack>().Go();
```

Get it on [Nuget](https://nuget.org/packages/ScriptCs.Nancy/).

## Quickstart (Interactive)

* Ensure you have [scriptcs installed](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs#getting-scriptcs).
* Open a command prompt *as an administrator*.
* Create a folder, e.g. `mkdir C:\hellonancy`.
* Navigate to your folder and run `scriptcs -install ScriptCs.Nancy`.
* Run `scriptcs`.
* Enter `public class Foo : NancyModule { public Foo() { Get["/"] = _ => "Hi!"; } }`
* Enter `Require<NancyPack>().Go().Browse();`

Congratulations! You've created your first *interactively* self-hosted website using scriptcs and Nancy! :trophy:

## Quickstart (Script)

* Ensure you have [scriptcs installed](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs#getting-scriptcs).
* Open a command prompt *as an administrator*.
* Create a folder, e.g. `mkdir C:\hellonancy`.
* Navigate to your folder and run `scriptcs -install ScriptCs.Nancy`.
* Create a file named `start.csx` containing a sample module and a magic line of code:

```C#
Require<NancyPack>().Host();

public class SampleModule : NancyModule
{
    public SampleModule()
    {
        Get["/"] = _ => "Hello World!";
    }
}
```

* Run `scriptcs start.csx`.
* Browse to `http://localhost:8888/`.

Congratulations! You've created your first *scripted* self-hosted website using scriptcs and Nancy! :trophy:

(Take a look at a slightly more [advanced sample](https://github.com/adamralph/scriptcs-nancy/blob/master/src/sample/host1.csx).)

## How it works

ScriptCs.Nancy auto-magically finds all modules in your script/session  (including those loaded with [`#load`](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Writing-a-script#loading-referenced-scripts "Loading referenced scripts")) and all modules in any [referenced assemblies](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Writing-a-script#referencing-assemblies). The names of all modules found are printed in the console window. If any modules have dependencies, they are also auto-magically wired up! :sunglasses:

`Go()` and `Stop()` start and stop hosting. `Host()` is a convenience for script writing. It calls `Go()`, waits for the user to press a key and then calls `Stop()`. Use it in place of `Go()` in any examples if you need this behaviour.

By default, the base URL of your site is `http://localhost:8888/`. You can easily change this to another URL or even multiple URL's (see 'Advanced Usage'). All base URL's being used are printed in the console window. 

The most commonly used Nancy namespaces are also imported into your script/session:
* `Nancy`
* `Nancy.Bootstrapper`
* `Nancy.Conventions`
* `Nancy.Cryptography`
* `Nancy.ErrorHandling`
* `Nancy.Hosting.Self`
* `Nancy.ModelBinding`
* `Nancy.Security`
* `Nancy.Validation`

You can import more namespaces with your own `using` statements. If you think another namespace should be imported by default, please [create an issue](https://github.com/adamralph/scriptcs-nancy/issues/new/) or [send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Advanced Usage

### Interactive Tips

When using scriptcs interactively, assign a variable to `NancyPack` to save your wrists:

```C#
> var n = Require<NancyPack>();
> n.Go();
> n.Browse();
> #load "hhgtg.csx"
> n.At(42, 54, 66).Go().BrowseAll("vogons/poetry");     // also chain method calls whenever possible
```
(See below for an explanation of these methods.)

### Custom URL's

```C#
At(777)                                                 // http://localhost:777
At(777, 888)                                            // http://localhost:777 and http://localhost:888
At("http://localhost/abc/")
At("http://localhost/abc/", "http://localhost/def/")
```
### Interactive browsing

`Browse()` opens your default browser using the root URL of the host (or the first URL if multiple URLs are being used).

`BrowseAll()` opens a browser window for each root URL when multiple URLs are being used.

To browse to a specific resource, pass the relative address of the resource as an argument, e.g. `Browse("hello")` or `BrowseAll("hello")`. 

### Manually registering dependencies

Nancy's built in auto registration works perfectly well in the scriptcs environment as demonstrated in [this sample](https://github.com/adamralph/scriptcs-nancy/blob/master/src/sample/host1.csx). If you don't want to take advantage of this feature you can also [manually register your dependencies](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Bootstrapping-nancy#part-2---manually-registering-dependencies "Manually Registering Dependencies") as shown in [this sample](https://github.com/adamralph/scriptcs-nancy/blob/master/src/sample/host2.csx).

### Managing the host yourself

If you don't want to take advantage of the built in hosting in ScriptCs.Nancy, you can also manage the lifetime of the host yourself:
```C#
using (var host = new NancyHost(new DefaultNancyPackBootstrapper(), new Uri("http://localhost:8888/")))
{
    host.Start();    
    Console.ReadKey();
}
```
Note that `DefaultNancyBootstrapper` is not suited to scriptcs. `DefaultNancyPackBootstrapper` inherits from `DefaultNancyBootstrapper` and is specifically designed to work with scriptcs.

## HttpListenerException :scream:

Two common causes:

1. You do not have permission to host an HTTP listener at the desired URL. This can be solved by running your command prompt as an administrator or following the steps described [here](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Self-Hosting-Nancy#httplistenerexception).

1. Another process is already listening  at the desired URL. Kill the other process and re-try.
